    					<p>One microphone might not be enough to cover your entire home. That's why it's possible to turn additional controllers into 'satellites'. One controller will act as the coordinator in your home. Satellites send their voice recordings to that central hub.</p>

							<p>Each controller in your local network should have a unique "domain name", which identifies it on the local network. This controller is currently still using the default name. Having two controllers with the same default domain name on the same network will cause problems. Before you add a second controller, make sure to first change this controllers' hostname into something different and unique. It should be one word, such as "kitchen" or "bedroom".</p>
                            <p>After you changed the name you will then be able to access this controller by typing that new name into a browser (whenever you're on the local network).

                                <p>Matrix is like a cross between email and Whatsapp/Signal. Where Apps like Whatsapp have a central server that controls the entire chat network, with Matrix it's more like email, where lots of different servers exchange the messages. And as with email you can choose what provider you trust your messages with.</p>
                                <p>This design means no single organisation owns the chat network. Anyone can create a server, and then these servers route the messages between them so they get to the intented destination. You could even run your own server if you wanted, which would give you very high levels of control over your data.</p>
                                <p>This is made possible by the Matrix software that all these servers run. Matrix is open source, managed by the Matrix.org foundation, and supported by a worldwide community of people and organisations. The open source nature means the programming code can be viewed by anyone, including you. You can even help improve it. For many people this level of transparency allows for greater levels of trust.</p>
                                <p>The Matrix software can encrypt the messages, and Voco enables this for all the messages it sends.</p>

                        <p>There are numerous ways to log into your Matrix account. You can use the web application of any server that is part of the Matrix network. For example, you could log in at <a href="https://matrix.domainepublic.net">matrix.domainepublic.net</a>, which is the server where Voco has created an account for you.</p>
                        
                        <p>You might also enjoy using a dedicated mobile app. Just as there are many Matrix chat servers, there are many apps available. Popular open source options are:</p>

					<h2>How to use Voco</h2>
					<p>Voice control is really fun and useful, especially when you know your data stays in your own home.</p>
                    
                    <p>You can disable Voco's ability to respond to commands are any time by switching the "Listening" property of the Voice control thing to off.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Examples</h4>
                    <p>Here are some example commands. Because Voco uses machine learning it is very flexible, and you can say the commands in many different ways.</p>

                    <h3>How to use Chat</h3>
                    <p>Voco does only offers 100% local voice control, but you can also connect it to a messaging network called Matrix.</p>
                    <p>Matrix is very similar to messaging apps like Whatsapp and Signal (it even uses the same encryption standard), but it's even more privacy friendly. If you enable this feature, then you can literally chat with your home as if you were in a Whatsapp or Signal conversation.</p>
                    <p><img src="/extensions/voco/images/candle_voco_chat2.png" alt="Chatting using Matrix" style="display:block;width:50%;margin:2rem auto"/></p>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Basics</h4>
                    <p>Generally the reply to a command will be sent to back the where it came from. If you use your voice to give a command to Voco, then Voco will speak the response out loud. If you use a text message to give Voco a command, the response will be sent back as a text message.</p>
                    <p>There are a few exceptions to this rule:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
						    <li>Timers, alarms and reminders will always also be spoken out loud. So it you send a chat message "set a timer for 10 seconds", when the timer finishes you will receive a message saying "your timer is finished", and that message will be spoken out loud too.</li>
                            <li>An exception is the countdown, which will only speak out loud. This is to avoid spamming the chat room with lots of messages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Another exception is that you can use these special text commands:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
						    <li>Start a message to Voco with <span class="extension-voco-bold">speak:</span>, and Voco will say that text out loud for you.</li>
                            <li>Start a message to Voco with <span class="extension-voco-bold">speak everywhere:</span>, and Voco will say that text out loud for you through all the Voco satellites as well.</li>
                            <li>Start a message to Voco with <span class="extension-voco-bold">popup:</span>, and the message will be shown on a popup in the interface.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Managing participants</h4>
                    <p>If you use the chat functionality, then Voco will create a "chat room". You can invite multiple people to that room, and each person can send commands to Voco.</p>
                    <p>To protect the privacy of participants, newly invited members cannot see what messages were previously exchanged.</p>
                    
                     <h4>Notifications</h4>
                    <p>If you create a rule you may notice that voco comes with two "notifiers". In your notifier you can set three things: a title, a message, and a priority level.</p>
                    <p><img src="/extensions/voco/images/candle_voco_matrix_notification.png" alt="Chatting using Matrix" style="display:block;width:50%;margin:2rem auto"/></p>
                    <p>The Speech notifier will get Voco to say something out loud. You can use either the title or message fields for this message (or both). The level value currently isn't used.</p> 
                    <p>The Matrix notifier can be used to send text notifications to your mobile devices. This has three levels:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
						    <li>On the low priority level the title and message are shown as a simple line of text.</li>
                            <li>On the medium priority level the title is shown as bold text.</li>
                            <li>On the high priority level both the title and message are shown as bold text. On top of that a message will pop-up in the Candle controller interface.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Enabling and disabling chat control</h4>
                    <p>You can at any time enable or disable chat control of your home. The Voice Control thing has a property called "Chat". When it is off Voco will ignore any incoming commands.</p>
                    <p>You can decide if you want notifications to still be sent out when chat funcionality is disabled. Visit the Voco settings page to change your preference.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Why Matrix?</h4>
                    <p>The great thing about Matrix is that it's a distributed ("federated") messaging network. This means it operates much like email, where there are multiple servers that exchange messages. You're not tied to one company, as you are with apps like Whatsapp. Anyone can run one of these servers and become part of the network.</p>
                    <p>The small downside is that this means your conversations with Voco will be stored on a third party server. We only use servers we trust. Currently this is a server by the French NGO domainepublic.net. If Candle becomes popular enough then we will setup our own Matrix server.</p>
                    <p>The Matrix software is open source, and is managed by a non-profit foundation. Learn more at matrix.org.</p>

                    <h3>Privacy</h3>
                    <p>Voco's voice functionality does not make any connections to the outside world. Period.</p>
                    <p>The chat funtionality will become active once you create an account or prove your existing Matrix username. Before that moment no connections to outside Matrix servers are made.</p>
                    <p>Note that disabling the chat functionality using the Voice control thing does not stop communication with the Matrix server. It's just that incoming messages are ignored, and outgoing messages are only sent if you allow this in the Voco settings.</p>
                    
                    <p>To better understand how your data is stored on the Matrix server, please read the privacy policy of the server itself. Candle's webserver is at no point involved in the chat functionality.</p>
